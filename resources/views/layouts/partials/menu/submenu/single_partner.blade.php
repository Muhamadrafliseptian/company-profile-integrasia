            <p>As a world leader in continuing education, the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies (SCPS) offers over 2500 courses
            in a variety of subjects. The SCPS website hosts millions of visitors every year, all looking to register for courses and get information
            on building their careers. Kanban began working with NYU in 2006.</p><br>
            <h4>Challenge</h4>
            <p>The SCPS Marketing Department turned to Kanban for help in reengineering the SCPS website on a modern, scalable, and
            cost-effective content management platform. SCPS had a large number of stakeholders to accommodate and needed to plan for
            yet-to-be-determined future requirements.</p><br>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>Kanban designed and implemented a new web content management system to support the SCPS website. Kanban selected best-of-breed
            technologies that provided the right solution for each of NYU’s needs. <br><br>The content management and other site services were
            all successfully integrated into a unified web application that provided seamless experience for students and SCPS administrators.
            The OpenCms open source content management system seamlessly integrated into the application architecture to provide the highest
            degree of control over site content, while still offering unlimited flexibility.</p><br>
            <h4>Results</h4>
            <p>
                Kanban and NYU realized the following benefits:
                <ul>
                    <li>The implementation of open source software and frameworks saved NYU the costs associated with software licensing, an estimated $250K.</li>
                    <li>By outsourcing to Kanban, NYU reduced project lifecycle by 75%.</li>
                    <li>NYU’s marketing department and other non-technical staff can now support off-line campaigns, add new pages, post news, manage faculty bios, etc.</li>
                </ul>
